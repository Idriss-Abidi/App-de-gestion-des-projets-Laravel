#Verify the PHP Installation
Ensure PHP is properly installed and working:

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Run the following command:

php -v

If PHP is installed, this will display the PHP version.

#Check Laravel Project Setup
Ensure you have all necessary Laravel dependencies:

#Navigate to your project directory:
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\App-de-gestion-des-projets-Laravel

#Install Composer dependencies:
composer install

#Install npm dependencies (if you decide to use npm later):
npm install


#Ensure Database Configuration
Ensure your .env file has the correct database configuration:
env

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3307
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password


#Create and Migrate the Database
Create the database manually using the database.sql file.


#To run the Laravel development server, use:
php artisan serve

Ensure your vendor folder and all required packages are installed. If the vendor folder is missing the necessary files, you might need to run composer install again.
